practice programming scripts

this is just a bunch of python scripts i wrote while teaching myself programming. most of them do really dumb and silly things.
i really only uploaded it to git to 1) preserve it as history and 2) teach myself git. in fact, i'm writing this README right now
so that i can practice doing git pull to get it.
